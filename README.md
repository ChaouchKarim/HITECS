This paper proposes a framework to help engineers systematically specify CPS HiL test cases and analyze HiL testing risks. Leveraging the UML pro le mechanism, we develop an executable domain-speci c language, HITECS, for HiL test case specification. HITECS builds on the UML Testing Pro le (UTP) and the UML action language (Alf). Using HITECS, we provide analysis methods to ensure that HiL test cases are well-behaved, and to estimate the execution time of these test cases before the actual HiL testing phase. We apply HITECS to an industrial case study from the satellite domain. Our results show that HITECS helps engineers de ne more complete and e ective well-behavedness assertions for HiL test cases, compared to when these assertions are de ned without systematic guidance; HITECS veri es in practical time that HiL test cases are well-behaved; and HITECS accurately estimates HiL test case execution times.
